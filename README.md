# Story of this game 🏚️

This game was one of the most memorable projects in my freelancing journey! 💖 I worked with one of my **best clients** 🥇, who shared a passion for card games like **Yu-Gi-Oh!** 🎮🀄️. Together, we dreamed of creating a game that would bring back the nostalgia of strategic card battles while introducing new mechanics to excite modern players 🔥.

However, my journey with this project took an unexpected turn 🎪. As I was nearing the final stages of development ⌛, I received an offer for a **new venture** 🌐✨—a top-secret opportunity that I couldn’t refuse 🎥🚫 (no spoilers!). This meant I had to leave the project incomplete ❌, a decision that was as bittersweet as it was thrilling.

Even though I couldn’t finish this game, the collaboration was a journey of creativity, learning, and camaraderie 💞. It remains a significant chapter in my story, filled with lessons and unforgettable moments 🕊️.
